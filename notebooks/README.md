# Getting Data

* [how to get full world cup 2014 play-by-play data](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rjtavares/football-crunching/blob/master/notebooks/how%20to%20get%20full%20play-by-play%20data%20for%20the%20WC2014.ipynb): Good football data is hard to come by. Basic stat counts are easily available, but full play data (i.e. a play broken down in its individual components: interceptions and tackles, runs, passes and shots, etc.) is very rare. And that's the most important unit in a team sport like football. So imagine my surprise and great joy when I came across a fantastic dataset of full play-by-play data for all World Cup matches.

# Analysis

* [an exploratory analysis of the world cup final](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rjtavares/football-crunching/blob/master/notebooks/an%20exploratory%20data%20analysis%20of%20the%20world%20cup%20final.ipynb): This notebook shows how you can use play-by-play data to analyse a football match, showing custom measures and visualizations to better understand the sport.

# Statistics

* [how likely is it to score from 45 meters](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rjtavares/football-crunching/blob/master/notebooks/how%20likely%20is%20it%20to%20score%20from%2045%20meters.ipynb): we use a logistic regression to model the probability of scoring based on the distance from the goal
